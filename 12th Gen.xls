It only has 4 cores but they are so fast that it can compete with other processors like the 5600G. The integrated graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done and have allowed me to run light games like Roblox and Civ VI while I save for a graphics card. The stock cooler is not amazing at cooling but the i3 12100 doesn't take much power so while any new cooler would probably be an improvement, this one has been doing just fine. For anyone building a PC on a budget, I can easily say this is a great CPU.

R33HLU0C89P4WO,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day. If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks. Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things. I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now).",Reviewed in the United States on 19 May 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars

R122M0O2R8DRCC,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing. I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows.

R1LYNE32MIF166,"I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc. I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance. Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing.

R2J1WZ6WYYHX2Y,"My last I3 was the gen 9, so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a PINLESS CPU (pins are on the motherboard) was a big surprise and a bit of a relief. Overall I am damned happy with the upgrade, its not a top end gaming PC but its more than enough. I don't do competitive FPS games, RTX lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur - basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters. That said the one complaint I do have falls on Amazon. You'd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right? Nope. Paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn. The fact that the RAM didn't fall out the hole and that the CPU works fine is a relief.",Reviewed in Canada on 3 August 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars
R1HRPEZ6ILILF0,I can only recommend this CPU for gaming. Why? Because most games only use 4-6 cores. The i3 12100f is perfect for economical final performance.

The stock cooler provided is also amazing and simple to install, but would have preferred if it came with metal mounting screws instead of cheap-feeling plastic push pins. The price is well below other retail shops in Singapore including Sim Lim square. Although it is shipped from overseas, it is genuine and the packaging arrived sealed and undamaged. The shipping time also took less than a week.

R28M3E5WJSK89O,"Upgraded a 2600K pc with this CPU, B660 board and 32GB of 3600mhz ram.  It feels incredibly snappy now.  With GPUs now costing your firstborn child, it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%.  (@2560x1080)  Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now. The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating.  It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead. The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.  Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.

For the price it's dang near perfect.  It's about 20% slower at generating tool paths than an i5-12600k but way faster than the previous generation CPUs.  It's definitely a jump forward from the i5-11400 and about equivalent of an i5-11600k or a 10th gen i7,Reviewed in the United States on 13 May 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars

And you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests.

I have bought 2 so far and I even paired them with a budget ASRock B660 motherboard and still performed at highest speeds with  135W PL2. This CPU will definitely last a good 5 years since it has great IPC performance and is compatible with DDR5 RAM. All this for approx $180-220 is a bargain. If you don't need to overclock or don't want to spend a great deal of money this is the CPU for you.

Unfortunately, it shipped without a backplate, and dealing with Intel support, they had me recount the same problem three times three different ways before telling me they were going to contact *management* to see *if* they could replace it, and told me I should consider RMA'ing it back through Amazon.  What the heck?  In other words, if I don't get an email by tomorrow afternoon from a call center manager I'm supposed to return the whole thing to Amazon and buy a different processor.  That's nuts! Update from customer service: The supervisor of the first two people called me back from a number that registered as a potential spam caller.  He said they don't send the backplate to their own cooler, except sometimes, it seems to be dependent on what box you have.  They operate on the expectation the mobo manufacturer sent the backplate.  However, he was sending it to *his* boss to see if they could send me the backplate to one of their own coolers. It was like talking to a Best Buy rep that's been instructed to sound knowledgeable when they aren't.

R1YIG2BGFGUCKY,"The cpu is overall great for everything, itâ€™ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnâ€™t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you donâ€™t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022,4.0 out of 5 stars

R2P0ICTL54XIT0,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste. I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p. One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!) The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.

R2ANZ56FIC0ZXR,"As it should be, instead of© buying laptops and pre-assembled, a real nerd builds his own computer, and in addition to this, he shares his experience in the ancient art of PC Building with friends and family. My brother needed to use a computer, and imagining the sadness of seeing him with a laptop, a pre-assembled or even worse with a Mac, I thought of building him a custom-made computer. And anyway, what better way to convert someone to PC Gaming than with a computer assembled with a lot of brotherly love? So I decided to choose this processor because© since it is a build basically for school use + gaming, and with a relatively limited budget (ok brotherly love is everything but let's not exaggerate), it seemed to me the best compromise between performance and quality. In the end the seller sent me the 12400F, but I wanted the 12400, so I made the return, and I bought the 12500 which is identical anyway apart from the integrated GPU and slightly higher frequencies, so I can review it anyway since they are basically the same processor. It is a 6-core, 12-thread processor, which does not have the elusive E-cores of the more expensive series (for example, the 12600 has 6P-Cores like this plus 4E-Cores that help in background operations, especially if you use Windows 11), at a frequency of 2.5 Ghz with a boost of up to 4.4Ghz if the temperatures,  The workload, and your motherboard allow it. A processor of this type excels in gaming, but it doesn't suck even in the most complicated operations, in fact this processor also performs very well in video editing with Adobe Premiere.I combined it with a Gigabyte 12G RTX3060 and 32Gb of DDR4 at 3200Mhz, all on an Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE AND TEMPERATUREWhat I said before,  It's a mid-range processor that's particularly good at gaming, but it handles even the most ""professional"" operations without a hitch. The architecture of these twelfth generation Intel processors, after a fairly disappointing eleventh generation, is excellent. Without giving the numbers with benchmarks and other incomprehensible things, I can tell you that in gaming it behaves at the same level as the good old Ryzen 5 5600X, undoubtedly the best mid-range processor together with this one. I don't think you'll have any problems in gaming or productivity using this processor, assuming the rest of the hardware is up to scratch. I use it with trivial DDR4 at 3200Mhz, so in terms of performance we are similar to the 5600X I had on one of my builds last year, but if you combine it with some serious DDR5 it can certainly surpass it even if only slightly. In any case, it performs very well in gaming, especially when combined with a somewhat serious GPU (like my RTX3060). I didn't notice any bottlenecks, especially in the case of this build, which will be used with a ""only"" 1080p monitor. As for temperatures, it's a fairly quiet CPU with a TDP of only 65W. I don't have a heatsink at the moment, because© I didn't get one, so I'm using the stock heatsink included in the box. I expected it to be pitiful, but it's definitely acceptable. Temperatures don't exceed 70C in gaming, even with heavy games, while making the most of it with a Cinebench, it doesn't exceed 80C, which is acceptable and well below the throttling threshold of 100C. The noise of the original fan is also quite low, so boh, maybe I'll keep it with the stock heatsink. Surely anyway my case, an NZXT with 4 additional fans, helps a lot, in addition to this I didn't trust the veil of pre-applied thermal paste, and I put my trusty Gelid GC Extreme on it, because© for a 65W processor with the dissi stock surely you need an Extreme level thermal paste. TRAY OR BOX? INTEGRATED GPU? The difference between the two versions lies in the availability of the integrated GPU. The F version doesn't include it, and generally costs a little less. Depending on the price difference, consider whether to take one or the other. I'm not a fan of Intel integrated GPUs and I always try to combine a dedicated GPU whenever possible, even if it's very poor. In this case I have the RTX3060 that it's a good gaming card, so why© did I want to get the processor with the integrated GPU? © Because with certain programs that support Intel Quicksync technology, the integrated GPU doesn't sit there and is actively used for video encoding or other operations, such as the timeline in Premiere. The little brother uses Adobe Premiere which can take advantage of this technology, but other video editing or streaming programs also use it, such as OBS Studio, which can take advantage of the video encoder of the integrated GPU to trim, leaving the dedicated GPU free for gaming. In any case, the Integrated GPU is the usual Intel UHD, on the 12400 it's the UHD 730, on the 12500 it's the 770. I haven't tested it much in gaming, but don't expect anything. The power of this is similar to dedicated entry level laptops from a few years ago like the 930M or so, so it's good for light gaming. In any case, it has no problems whatsoever when it comes to viewing videos or 3D images that are not particularly complex, it easily supports 4k videos on youtube or retro games and various emulators. As for other cryptic nomenclatures, we sometimes see Tray or Box, the difference between the two is the presence of the heatsink in the Box version. As I said above, the heatsink is poor but for a CPU like this it's enough. If you don't need it, get the Tray version.DO I TAKE THE 12400, 12500 OR 12600? In my opinion, among these three the best is the 12400 and I'll also explain why©. The 12400 and 12500 are siblings, while the 12600 is for all intents and purposes the superior model. Let's start with the 12500, this processor has the same base as the 12400 but with slightly higher base and boost frequencies, as well as a slightly more powerful integrated GPU (i.e. the Intel UHD 770 vs. the 730 of the 12400). Higher frequencies basically translate into a static improvement of 5% on average, plus or minus depending on the workload, but practically never above 10%. The integrated GPU is slightly more powerful, but it's still a very poor integrated and not suitable for gaming regardless. If the price difference was about ten euros it could also be there, but honestly I can't think of any reason why the 12500 deserves to exist at almost 100â'¬ more. Avoid it. I bought it only because© I needed it in a hurry and the seller made a mistake in sending me the 12400F instead© of the 12400. Otherwise I would never have bought it. The 12600 is on a different playing field, and is for all intents and purposes the superior model. As I said at the beginning, in addition to the 6 P-Cores the 12600 has 4 E-Cores, as well as higher frequencies, and the K version if you want to overclock. For the price of almost 150â'¬ above the 12400, it could also fit if it's within your budget and you do heavy multitasking or a lot of rendering. In gaming they are practically the same, the difference between the two is perceived at high framerates and low resolutions, in AAA games maybe in 4k you will be limited by the GPU in most cases. In any case, if you want to build a PC with a higher budget than mine and maybe combined with a more powerful GPU than my 3060, it might be worth it, even if only for the presence of the E-Cores.Anyway, I think that the 12400 is the sweet spot, to be considered for any mid-range PC, possibly considering an upgrade in a few years to the 13xxx generation when the prices drop. CONCLUSIONWhat saying, the 12400 is a respectable CPU, at a very affordable price by the way. It's excellent in a mid-range gaming build, paired with a somewhat serious GPU, and doesn't struggle even in professional graphics programs (used at an amateur or school level). I'm definitely not telling you anything new, but I fully recommend it for mid-range builds and low budget.",Reviewed in Italy on 6 March 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars

The only drawback will be the new architecture, it will be the bios of the motherboards, but the turbo core does not go to 4.4Ghz on all cores at the same time (as it was on the previous 6xxx 7xxx series or on X99 or X299 platforms the famous ""enhanced turbo boost"" option is not implemented here) but stops at 4 gigahertz. However, I don't think it can change that much in gaming, given several comparative videos even with i7 and i9 of the same series and the fps are practically the same. which leaves a lot of questions about whether or not to spend 3 times as much to get little or nothing more, always remaining in the gaming field, in productivity surely processors with more threads will make the difference.",Reviewed in Italy on 26 March 2024,5.0 out of 5 stars

R16E4N4VJN61YU,"This is a pretty powerful, modern Intel processor which I bought when replacing my gaming PC. On this front, me and Intel agree and are friends, it was in fact a powerful enough processor for most forms of gaming, which was easy to install. However, do NOT use the stock cooler that comes with this thing! If you just want to run your average PC game (FF14, Halo, etc) then you'll find it is strong enough to handle that without breaking a sweat. However, if you are intending to do video or photo editing, or God forbid emulation, then you'll find yourself with the loudest, most ineffective fan I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. When I fast forward games in PCSX2, it can reach 90C which is 30 above what my previous computer's stock cooler would keep it locked at under any circumstances. I would tell you how hot it got trying to run RPCS3 but I immediately went for Task Manager to close the application after I saw it hit 100C! TL; DR: If you intend to use more than 30% of this processor's true capability, you cannot just use the cooler that comes with it. Extremely disappointing, and I'm kicking myself for not researching this more thoroughly, as I had erroneously thought from past experience that it could handle basic tasks without sounding like a helicopter taking off.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 May 2024,3.0 out of 5 stars

R1G80UIZJ1KGJW,"Purchased during Prime Day at 150â'¬, this processor carries 6 cores and 12 threads on its shoulders which, although it may seem obvious, has now become the standard for gaming, let's not kid ourselves. Even though the starting clock is 2.5GHz, be aware that the motherboard activates turbo boost and takes you up to 4.4GHz. As for the power consumption, in normal use it is below 60w (20-50w), in the games maximum it recorded (then it depends) a maximum load of 90w. Under stress, 117w precise, net, as stated by intel. Now, however, let's move on to the damn sore point that has been haunting these processors for years: the heatsink. I've tried several heatsinks, and I have to say that they've been committed, even if the push-pin system remains cumbersome (it doesn't fit perfectly). I know, it sounds strange to you, but even if it's not perfectly hooked, it still covers the entire dissipating surface, you can rest assured. In-game, the maximum temperature I recorded (with ambient temperature of 35°C) was 85°C.  Then when I tried with room temperature of 25°C, the temperature dropped to 78°C! These seem like high values, but trust me, for a stock heatsink it does its dirty work. For this reason I give 4 stars. UPDATE August 3, 2023I turned off the ™intel Turbo Boost and now, even when I play, it never rises above 68°C, thus lowering the temperature by 10°C. Even if you lose that 4.4GHZ, know that it's equally performant and you don't have any stability issues. So I update the review to 5 starsMID-AUGUST UPDATEðŸ""¥The stock heatsink has abandoned me, temperatures skyrocketed to 100°C and then goes into protection. Apparently it has to be fitted perfectly otherwise it won't make it. So I'm replacing it with a tower.

I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process.

Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors. I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them. I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better.

I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs. I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.

My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith.

R3159N0Z64VB87,"So I ordered this 12600K as it was for sale on BF, when I recieved order, I started to install it on my MB(MSÄ° B660M MORTAR WIFI DDR4). Insalation went without any problem, but when I tried to turn it on, CPU light on MB turned red, then DRAM lights turned yellow, it cycled like this for 3-4 times and then it went to DRAM lights yellow only. I tried to swap RAM, BIOS flash, reset, tried to to plug out and in CPU pin connectors and etc. It just didn't worked, but it wasn't main problem, when I tried to pu my old cpu(12400) back to MB it didn't turned on also, sayÄ±n same problems. I took my PC to service, there was no damage to any hardware, including MB pins. Somehow your faulty 12600K did shenanigans on my MB so service had to, as much as I understand BIOS reset or flash my MB again for my old CPU to work. Extremely disappointed.

R36BZUTVGAZ7FN,"No support for deepcool heatsinks, wasted time modifying it to fit, (it does work, but wasted a couple hours on a process that should take 5-10 minutes). I have never had so much trouble get a cpu to run in linux. Good grief, Iâ€™m a computer expert by trade, and intel should have waited to release this series. I know the competition is tough, but I definitely wont go and buy another one of these. I thought it would be a good investment. I may have damage my motherboard on install, as the cpu slip out of my hands and banged up against the socket bent some pins. It was so hard to get running under linux, graphics support is nonexistent, i can only the XE2 new graphics cards will be more of the same since these are based on that Technology. You can find a work around on Phoronix for the graphics problem, however the image on linux sucks itâ€™s more pixelated than i would like. I would like to mention I needed to my rx 580 to get this thing running as the Linux OS didnâ€™t recognize the GFX chip on the cpu. And with the way the situation is with gpuâ€™s Iâ€™m lucky to have had one at hand. The Bios also doesnâ€™t show on my pc correctly if you use the onboard Intel graphics, its cutoff . Also the hard drive was not recognized with the motherboard but it happed two motherboard asrock and gigabyte. I had to install a new elilo version to get the efi to work. What can i say the performance is good, but runs hot 120 watts at the cpu when doing multithreaded task like compiling the kernel. It does that fast but Ryzen 12 core does it faster and with less power 95watts. Itâ€™s hard to say this was an upgrade, my head hurts whenever an issue comes up with this cpu. Now after about month of use the gfx is acting weird, it starts to fragment / pixelated and gets stuck. Iâ€™m sure intel knows and I probably should have just gotten a kf series instead because it is so bad now i just left the dang rx 580 in the system. Maybe Iâ€™m not the only one, Iâ€™m sure a class action lawsuit is in the works. I have not been able to enjoy this since I purchased on day one. I would have returned this but then I would have to return the motherboard to another vendor and i sure donâ€™t want to go to that trouble. I fortunately got ddr4 version so I reduced the amount of ram in the computer and will use it as is until it dies. Hopefully after this crypto boom Iâ€™ll be able to snag a ryzen 5th gen combo for cheap. My intel can fix this but it will be years before this happens. They are too busy playing catch up. The power efficiency is terrible and the whole experience is about as bad as it gets. Save yourself a headache and get something comparable like a 3700x or better. This is not worth the price or painful install procedures. I just thought it was ridiculous coming from intel, didnt they create the PCs we know of today??? Did i mention the bios was cuttoff on left and right edges so you cant read the functions??? Iâ€™m surprised Intel engineers released this, more of a sample than a final product. Buy something else, did i mention the cheapest motherboard sets you back around $200, so $500 into this ordeal is not a good experience, could have purchased 2 sets of used ryzen 7 8 core cpus and motherboard for the same money and ultimately gotten more performance in power usage and cpu.

R2KCHNJN8WNB0L,"I purchased this processor and was happy with it until I stumbled upon a youtube video that proclaimed that most memory doesn't run at it's max speed. My DDR5 memory did just that - it ran at 4000 instead of it's 5200 (and it is certified to run on this processor). In my motherboard's BIOS, I adjusted the memory to run at 5200 with XMP-1 (an ASUS setting). It crashed a lot, so I tried their XMP-2 setting and everything froze up. Next thing I knew, nothing worked! I bought new memory, a new motherboard and eventually a new processor. When I found out this processor was the part that went bad (and it has a 3 year warranty), I submitted a ticket to Intel and they concluded that I ""overclocked"" the processor by pushing the memory to 5200 and they sent me to their webpage that specified this processor has a 4800 limit. Since then, I looked at every page before the one they sent me and none of them said anything about the 4800 memory speed limit. If setting memory speed a little over 4800 will fry your processor, shouldn't there be warnings everywhere and in every step of your tweaking? I now have a fried processor sitting on my desk and who is to blame? Is it me for trying to get the best performance out of my hardware and never seeing any warnings about this? Or maybe for Intel for their XMP standard that doesn't give you any warnings - especially since this is their standard that they created. I give this processor 2 stars - 5 for performance, but 0 for getting my fried processor and blaming me for ignorance of technicalities that are not upfront and lack of a warning system that they could have and should have implemented to prevent such catastrophes.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 August 2022,2.0 out of 5 stars

I used to use a basic mini PC with an older i7 6700T but with this in my gaming PC is have next to no issue running HD graphics in games like GTA 5. And its amazing for the price.

R2Y3L2SDRSRIT2,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X. Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways... If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point. TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming. Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4. Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast! Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window). I hope this review helps people!",Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars

R1GARFUW9BUFKN,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...) that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",Reviewed in Canada on 5 August 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars

RV6AT54FDJYSS,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips. If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison. In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)",Reviewed in the United States on 2 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars

As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog. Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible. Good luck!",Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.

R2LPQMUJ2S72GM,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too).

R62PEA6UEGWAJ,"I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to. Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform. The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy. The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 April 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars

R2D5R8OKUM44B7,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again?

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",Reviewed in the United States on 21 February 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars

It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions. For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed. So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well. Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.

It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace.

RJ2BVQW0LGR8O,It's been less then 24hrs since I upgraded from an i7-8700 and could instantly tell a difference in performance. Haven't had the need to overclock since it handles streaming on twitch/kick with obs while playing games on the same PC very nicely at stock settings.,Reviewed in the United States on 9 July 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars
R21WOL9J6LYKYM,"I've only had it about a month, but so far it is complete overkill for gaming... I haven't seen it go above 50% pushing it as hard as I can other than stress testing lol.

R2HZM7NQ12BLWX,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2022,4.0 out of 5 stars

R3RMELKOSNIHWP,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU. Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal. If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry. My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes. Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting. Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside. Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision. Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 December 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars
R16AOFZAY54PX3,This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is fast. This also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure. Also if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance.

R2ZYNX670E2FT4,"Now has a thin film over it. Donâ€™t know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the CPU during the build. After all CPU is the most or second mot expensive component in a PC build. Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, couple with gen 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow",Reviewed in the United States on 22 August 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars
